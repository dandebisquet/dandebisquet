## Hi, I’m dandebisquet

I build projects at the intersection of **games**, **creative coding**, and **AI**.  
I like taking fun ideas and turning them into working software—especially when it involves **Unity**, **Python**, and **neural networks**.

## Interests
- Game development (Unity / C#)
- Programming related to art and visual ideas
- Understanding AI, neural networks, and how they work “from the inside”
- Turning small ideas into complete, playable / usable projects

## Featured Projects
### Neural Networks & AI
- **Neural Network from Scratch (Python)**  
  A from-the-ground-up implementation to understand the core mechanics of neural networks (forward pass, training loop, etc.).
- **Image Compression with a Neural Network (TensorFlow)**  
  A compression approach using a learned model, focused on experimentation and evaluation of results.

### Games & Bots
- **Ultimate 3D Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (Unity / C#)**  
  A 3D “mega” tic-tac-toe concept with nested boards and custom rules/interaction.
- **Scrabble Game with Bot Opponent (Python)**  
  A playable Scrabble-style game featuring an AI opponent.
- **Wordle Game + Solver (Python, Information Theory)**  
  A Wordle clone plus solver that uses information gain/entropy to choose guesses.

## Tech
- **Languages:** Python, C#
- **Tools/Frameworks:** Unity, TensorFlow
- **Focus Areas:** game logic, simulations, search/decision-making, neural networks, creative programming

## What I’m working on
- Improving UX and controls in my Unity projects
- Building more “art + code” experiments (generative visuals, interactive pieces)
- Going deeper on neural networks and ML fundamentals
